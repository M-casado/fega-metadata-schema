## Ticket / Issue reference
<!-- Provide a link to the GitHub issue, Jira ticket, or other tracker that this PR addresses.-->

## Summary of changes
<!-- A concise, high-level description of what your pull-request does. Focus on **why** the change is needed and **what** it achieves for FEGA. -->

## Contributor checklist
I confirm I read the contributing documentation and the following is checked:
* [ ] **Schema versions updated** – every **modified** JSON Schema has its `meta:version` incremented.
* [ ] **Schemas validate examples** – all schemas in [``schemas/``](../schemas/) are properly compiled by Biovalidator locally, and JSON examples in [``data/``](../data/) are valid against them.
<!-- The previous will also be checked by the GH workflows. -->
* [ ] **Documentation updated** – relevant pages under ``docs/`` (and any diagrams / examples) reflect my changes.
* [ ] **CHANGELOG touched** – my changes are reflected in the the [``CHANGELOG.md``](../CHANGELOG.md).

<!-- Feel free to extend the template as per your specific PR needs. Keep it short, actionable, and FEGA-specific. -->
